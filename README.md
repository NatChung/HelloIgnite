#  HelloIgnite
This is a practice project for [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) generated react native project. In this project, I will add a counterexample to test redux/saga from Ignite generate command also include generating container

## Ignite generate command

```makefile
âœ¨ Type ignite generate ________ to run one of these generators:

  component   Generates a component, styles, and an optional test.
  container   Generates a redux smart component.
  listview    Deprecated - Use `list`
  list        Generates a screen with a ListView/Flatlist/SectionList + walkthrough.
  redux       Generates a action/creator/reducer set for Redux.
